# Learning MVC ASP.net

### Some things you will need before starting:

- A drive to learn and figure problems out (anyone can learn how to code!)
- A computer that can install ASP.NET Core
- An IDE is needed for the sane individual. The "perferred" editor for ASP.Net is usually Visual Studio I am using Visual Studio Community 2019, it is free
- You should know I am not an experienced ASP.Net developer, I am learning and as I learn I am publishing what I learn to hopefully help at least one other person.

### Setting up the development Environment

###### Using VS Communtiy Edition

1. [Download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) Visual Studio and install it.
2. At the setup page select the ASP.NET and web development option. (You can select other options too if you want them installed)
3. To make sure everything was installed correctly startup VS. Select start a new project and select the ASP.Net Core option. There are many different templates the one we want is the MVC (Model View Controller) template.

###### Using ASP.Net Core Only
1. [Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/?&ef_id=CjwKCAiAluLvBRASEiwAAbX3GY4wsBwj3cTPrBdbboU-SXnC-cHS8lEtNvWgFMQk_Rhe05XQLZmEWRoCFgoQAvD_BwE:G:s&_aid=&OCID=AID2000725_SEM_CjwKCAiAluLvBRASEiwAAbX3GY4wsBwj3cTPrBdbboU-SXnC-cHS8lEtNvWgFMQk_Rhe05XQLZmEWRoCFgoQAvD_BwE:G:s)
ASP.Net Core and install it.
2. Type in dotnet into your console to see if everything installed correctly.
3. I will personally be moving forward with the tutorial using VS. I will not be 
providing a step by step for this environment at the moment. Everything is still
possible using only ASP.Net Core.
