# Learning MVC ASP.net

### Some things you will need before starting:

- A drive to learn and figure problems out (anyone can learn how to code!)
- A computer that can install ASP.NET Core
- An IDE is needed for the sane individual. The "perferred" editor for ASP.Net is usually Visual Studio I am using Visual Studio Community 2019, it is free
- You should know I am not an experienced ASP.Net developer, I am learning and as I learn I am publishing what I learn to hopefully help at least one other person.

### Setting up the development Environment

###### Using VS Communtiy Edition

1. [Download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) Visual Studio and install it.
2. At the setup page select the ASP.NET and web development option. (You can select other options too if you want them installed)
3. To make sure everything was installed correctly startup VS. Select start a new project and select the ASP.Net Core option. There are many different templates the one we want is the MVC (Model View Controller) template.

###### Using ASP.Net Core Only
1. [Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/?&ef_id=CjwKCAiAluLvBRASEiwAAbX3GY4wsBwj3cTPrBdbboU-SXnC-cHS8lEtNvWgFMQk_Rhe05XQLZmEWRoCFgoQAvD_BwE:G:s&_aid=&OCID=AID2000725_SEM_CjwKCAiAluLvBRASEiwAAbX3GY4wsBwj3cTPrBdbboU-SXnC-cHS8lEtNvWgFMQk_Rhe05XQLZmEWRoCFgoQAvD_BwE:G:s)
ASP.Net Core and install it.
2. Type in dotnet into your console to see if everything installed correctly.
3. I will personally be moving forward with the tutorial using VS. I will not be 
providing a step by step for this environment at the moment. Everything is still
possible using only ASP.Net Core.

### What to do if you get stuck on an issue
By the time you follow this tutorial things might be old or broken if I don't keep everything
updated. A very important part of learning how to code is learning to deal with problems and solve them.
There are great resources to help you find ways to solve any problem you might have. I personally am
learning and writing this course with help from Google and the great people that answer our questions everyday.
Other than Google, another great resource is the code docs! You don't have to read everything and remember it all
my goal is not to learn everything about a certain programming language it is to build applications using the
tools we already have.

You can always look back at the [Github](https://github.com/ch4nc3l0/MrWeatherMan-Weather-Learning-MVC-ASP.NET) page I will make commits in a structured way to allow anybody to look for what 
they are stuck on.

### What is ASP.Net, and ASP.Net Core
ASP.Net is a framework or library of code from many different developers that make it fast and easy to develop
applications. It is basically a standard that everyone can use so they don't have to write code that has already
been written over and over again.

ASP.Net Core is an open source version of ASP.Net that is cross-platform and uses the C# or F# programming language.
