# Learning MVC ASP.net

### Some things you will need before starting:

- A drive to learn and figure problems out (anyone can learn how to code!)
- A computer that can install ASP.NET Core
- An IDE is needed for the sane individual. The "perferred" editor for ASP.Net is usually Visual Studio I am using Visual Studio Community 2019, it is free
- You should know I am not an experienced ASP.Net developer, I am learning and as I learn I am publishing what I learn to hopefully help at least one other person.
